### Guidelines

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! See the guidelines below and check out all the previous piano jams in the sidebar.

You are encouraged to share a recording (of YOU playing) in a post to /r/piano anytime during the month. **Please put "[Piano Jam]" somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for. People have posted without this tag before and it's not the end of the world of course, but it does mean I might miss your submission!**

Please try to use YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp for your links for accessibility & reliability.

* You do not have to complete or perfect pieces to submit them, and don't be afraid to simplify/shorten pieces. Also, don't be afraid to improvise or write your own ending to a looped piece of video game music, etc.

* Where there are multiple pieces within a category, I have ordered them from easiest to hardest and assigned a rough difficulty rating. Jazz is split into full arrangements (i.e. left and right hands notated) and lead sheets (melody and chords only).

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and accomplishments with the /r/piano community.

* You do not have to limit yourself to just one piece, you can submit as many as you like.

* If you have pieces you would like to suggest for future Piano Jams, please use our [suggestion form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5U5DA0OjN1HeaK-5Ue_s92HeZ5ud_2OynMb0WoKt1BPPwrg/viewform)

Thanks to /u/veviurka!
